### Pricing Strategies to Consider

##### Freemium: 

Offer a basic version of your software for free, with premium features behind a paywall. Users can try before they buy, but be wary of 'scammy' tactics that hide essential features until the last minute.
##### Free Trial: 

Let users try the full software for a limited time. This can be effective, but requiring a credit card upfront can reduce your potential user base.

##### One-Time Payment:

This upfront model yields quick returns but may be harder to justify than a recurring subscription, especially for ongoing services.

##### Tiered Subscriptions:

 Offer basic, mid-tier, and premium plans at different price points (often with discounts for longer commitments). This is common for most SaaS products.

##### Seat-Based Pricing: 

Charge per user, ideal for B2B and enterprise sales where multiple employees use the software.
##### Metered Billing:

Bill users based on actual usage (e.g., per image generated). This aligns pricing directly with customer value but can be less predictable.
